# Haptic Synchronization for Robotic Teleoperation
**Abstract**

Robotic surgery is rapidly expanding, yet institutions like Tan Tock Seng Hospital face a significant pre-training gap due to the absence of dry lab, wet lab, and simulation-based training infrastructure. This project addresses the unmet need for integrated motor-cognitive skill development by proposing a collaborative haptic teaching system that enables expert surgeons to guide novice hand movements through variable-stiffness haptic interaction. Grounded in clinical observations, expert interviews, and evidence from haptic feedback and collaborative motor-learning literature, the system targets key motor metrics—movement smoothness, path efficiency, and force modulation—as well as cognitive functions such as situational awareness and anatomical recognition. The proposed solution aims to bridge the steep transition between observation and proctorship, reduce training barriers, and provide an accessible, realistic platform for developing both technical and cognitive competencies essential for safe, efficient robotic surgery.
