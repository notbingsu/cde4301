# Interview with Dr. Zhenbang Liu on Surgical Training on 13 October 2025

**Question 1:**

Can you describe the training pathway for surgeons, specifically addressing the gap between observing a surgery and performing it hands-on? Are there intermediate steps?

Answer:

The training path depends on whether you are a medical student or a junior doctor.
1. Medical Students: They have very limited hands-on opportunities, typically restricted to simple procedures like suturing skin. They do not perform complex internal surgeries. For advanced procedures like robotic surgery, they have zero hands-on opportunities outside of occasional dry labs.
2. Junior Doctors (Post-Medical School): These doctors are in rotations (e.g., a 6-month surgical rotation). They start by assisting and observing. After gaining familiarity (usually 2-3 months in), they may get more hands-on roles. However, there's no specific, formal training program they must pass before this. It is highly dependent on the senior surgeon's discretion, the complexity of the surgery, and the time available. For a simple surgery with ample time, a junior might do more. If time is short, the senior surgeon may do everything.

Robotic Surgery Exception: Even junior doctors in training will not get hands-on experience with the robot. The learning curve is much longer and more structured.
In general, a junior doctor is assumed to have mastered the basic principles of surgery and suturing from medical school.

**Question 2:**

Could you clarify the different titles for doctors in training, such as "resident"?

Answer:

A House Officer is a medical school graduate in their first paid year, which is effectively the sixth year of their medical degree.
A Medical Officer is a doctor who is not in a specialist training program.
A Resident is a doctor accepted into a specialist training program (e.g., General Surgery, Urology). Residency can last 4-6 years.
A Specialist is someone who has completed their residency. They start as a Junior Consultant for two years before becoming a full Consultant.

**Question 3:**

You mentioned a fellowship in Australia. What is the purpose of a fellowship, and is it a requirement before performing complex procedures like a da Vinci surgery?

Answer:

In the Singapore system, a fellowship is for someone who is already a specialist. After being a Junior Consultant for two years, you can apply for a fellowship (usually 6-12 months) to gain deeper expertise in a sub-specialty. For me, my specialty is Urology, and my sub-specialty is Uro-oncology (urological cancers). My fellowship in Australia was at a center that specialized in robotic surgery for this, which is how I got the training.
A fellowship is not a mandatory precursor to getting hands-on experience. It is for advanced, sub-specialty training after you are already a qualified specialist. The fellowship programme is also not guaranteed. It depends on the MOH sponsorship. Thus a doctor can go it after their junior consultant year, or after a few years after being a consultant.

**Question 4:**

How does a surgeon gain the necessary experience to be accredited for robotic surgery after their training and fellowship?

Answer:

1. Junior Consultant Phase: During the two years as a Junior Consultant, you work under a senior surgeon. You assist in their robotic surgeries and, over time, are given control over easier parts of the procedure. Your hands-on involvement gradually increases.
2. Post-Fellowship Accreditation: When you return from a fellowship, you are not immediately allowed to perform robotic surgery independently. The hospital has a procedure-specific accreditation process. For robotic surgery at my hospital (Tan Tock Seng Hospital), you must perform 30 cases with a proctor (a senior, accredited surgeon) supervising you before the hospital recognizes you as accredited to operate alone. This process can take a very long time, as robotic cases may not be available every week. When available, it may only be once a week. That is because of the time-limited nature of the surgery, and the lack of senior surgeon availability.

**Question 5:**

What training methods and simulators are used for robotic surgery, and how do they compare to training for other procedures like laparoscopy?

Answer:

Robotic Surgery Training:
- Dry Lab: This involves using the actual da Vinci robot on inanimate objects. It's not very realistic because the environment is stable with no bleeding. Logistically, it's difficult because it requires using expensive, sterilized robotic instruments.
- Surgical Skills Simulator: This is a dedicated virtual reality module sold by Intuitive (the makers of da Vinci). It's far more realistic, with predefined training modules. I used this in Australia, but we don't have it in Singapore as it is extremely expensive (almost a million dollars).
- Laparoscopy Training:
There are far more intermediate training steps. We use laparoscopic box trainers, which are widely available, relatively cheap, and can be used with surplus reusable instruments. This makes practice much more accessible compared to robotics.


**Question 6:**

We are developing a training tool using a haptic device (3D Systems Touch). It has 3-degree-of-freedom force feedback but lacks rotational force feedback. How useful would this be for a complex task like suturing?

Answer:

Suturing involves a lot of rotation, but your device could still be very useful for specific sub-tasks. Here is a breakdown:
- Needle Loading: This involves some rotation, but the lack of rotational feedback would be "okay-ish."
Puncturing Tissue: This is a linear push, not a rotation. The force feedback here would be extremely useful. It could help a trainee feel the difference between puncturing a thin tissue like a urethra versus a thick, resistant one like the bladder.
- Driving the Needle Through Tissue: This is a pure rotational movement of the wrist, so the main benefit of your device would be tracking the motion, not feeling rotational resistance.
- Knot Tying (Throwing the Suture): This is less about pure wrist rotation and more about moving the instrument in a 3D circular path. As long as your device can track this spatial movement, it would be very helpful.
- Tightening the Knot: This is where force feedback is most critical. In actual robotic surgery, there is no haptic feedback, so surgeons often pull too hard and break the suture. Your device could simulate the tensile strength and teach the trainee the appropriate amount of force to apply.
Conclusion: Even without rotational force feedback, as long as the device can accurately track rotational movement, it would still be a very valuable training tool for key parts of the suturing process, especially for learning tissue resistance and knot tightening.
